Setup
===============
This section will guide you through the pre requisites for the workshop.
Please make sure to install the libraries before the workshop as the conference WiFi 
can get quite slow when having too many people downloading and installing things at the same 
time.

Python 3.x
++++++++++

3.7 Preferred

We will be using `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_.
Installing all of Python's packages individually can be a bit
difficult, so we recommend using `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ which
provides a variety of useful packages/tools.

To download Anaconda, follow the link https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and select
Python 3. Following the download, run the installer as per usual on your machine.

If you prefere not using Anaconda then this `tutorial <https://realpython.com/installing-python/>`_ can help you with the installation and 
setup.

If you already have Python installed but not via Anaconda do not worry.
Make sure to have either ``venv`` or ``pipenv`` installed. Then follow the instructions to set 
your virtual environment further down.

Git
+++

`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is a version control software that records changes
to a file or set of files. Git is especially helpful for software developers
as it allows changes to be tracked (including who and when) when working on a
project.

To download Git, go to the following link and choose the correct version for your
operating system: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

GitHub
++++++

GitHub is a web-based service for version control using Git. You will need
to set up an account at `https://github.com <https://github.com>`_. Basic GitHub accounts are
free and you can now also have private repositories.

Text Editors/IDEs
++++++++++++

Text editors are tools with powerful features designed to optimize writing code.
There are several text editors that you can choose from.
Here are some we recommend:

- `VS code <https://code.visualstudio.com//?wt.mc_id=pyconCZ-github-taallard>`_: this is your facilitator's favourite ðŸ’œ and it is worth trying if you have not checked it yet
- `Pycharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_
- `Atom <https://atom.io>`_

We suggest trying several editors before settling on one.

If you decide to go for VSCode make sure to also
have the `Python extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-python.python/&wt.mc_id=PyCon-github-taallard>`_
installed. This will make your life so much easier (and it comes with a lot of nifty
features ðŸ˜Ž).


Azure
+++++

You will need to get an Azure account as we will be using this to deploy the 
Airflow instance.

Follow `this link <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free//?wt.mc_id=PyCon-github-taallard>`_ 
to get an Azure free subscription. This will give you 150 dollars in credit so you
can get started.

If you are doing this tutorial live at PyCon US then your
facilitator will provide you with specific instructions to set up your Azure 
subscription. If you have not received these please let your facilitator know ASAP.

MySQL
++++++

We need MySQL to follow along the tutorial. Make sure to install it beforehand.

Note that you will need to have mysql up an running, please refer to 
`https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python <https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python>`_
for more details on how to get `mysql` running.

.. warning:: There are some issues with MySQL and the Python library in Mac so I have found that this gist has some valuable information on getting MYSQL up and running on Mac: `https://gist.github.com/nrollr/3f57fc15ded7dddddcc4e82fe137b58e <https://gist.github.com/nrollr/3f57fc15ded7dddddcc4e82fe137b58e>`_.

Also note that you will need to make sure that openssl is on your path so make sure this is added accordingly:
If using ``zshrc``:
::
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc


If even after folllowing these instructions you are getting compilation errors while installing 
`mysqlclient` on Mac try this:
::
    env LDFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" pip install mysqlclient

Next, you have to install ``mysql.connector``, use `this link <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/>`_ to get the 
library for your OS. We need `mysql.connector` to connect Python and the MySQL databases.

To check that this has been properly installed try running the following from the Python REPL
::
    import mysql.connector



Creating a virtual environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You will need to create a virtual environment to make sure that you have the right packages and setup needed to follow along the tutorial.
Follow the instructions that best suit your installation.

Anaconda
--------

If you are using Anaconda you can use this `environment.yaml` and install the 
dependencies via ``conda env create -f environment.yml``.
Once all the dependencies are installed you can activate your environment through the follwing commands 
::
    source activate airflow-env # Mac
    activate airflow-env        # Windows and Linux
To exit the environment you can use 
::
    deactivate airflow-env    


pipenv
-------

Create a directory for the tutorial, for example:
::
    mkdir airflow-tutorial 

and go to it (``cd airflow-tutorial``).

Once then save this `Pipfile` and install via ``pipenv install``.
This will install the dependencies, this might take a while so you can make yourself a brew in the meantime.

Once all the dependencies are installed you can run ``pipenv shell`` which will start a session with the correct virtual environment 
activated. To exit the shell session use ``exit``.

virtualenv
-----------
Create a directory for the tutorial, for example :
::
    mkdir airflow-tutorial 
and change directories into it (``cd airflow-tutorial``).
Now you  need to run venv 
::
    python3 -m venv env/airflow # Mac and Linux 
    python -m venv env/airflow  # Windows

this will create a virtual Python environment in the ``env/airflow`` folder.
Before installing the required packages you need to activate your virtual environment: 
::
    source env/bin/activate # Mac and Linux 
    .\env\Scripts\activate  # Windows 

Now you can install the packages using via pip ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

To leave the virtual environment run ``deactivate``
